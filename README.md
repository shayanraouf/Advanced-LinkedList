# Advanced-LinkedList
[Project Description](https://github.com/shayanraouf/Advanced-LinkedList/blob/master/Lab3_342.pdf)
This program requires usage of dynamic memory, pointers and linked lists and usage of File IO and C++ templates (known as generics in Java). Also, a good understanding of overloading assignment and copy constructors is required.
